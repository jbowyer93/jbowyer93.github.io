title: Project 1 - MTA Data Analysis
---

This week I worked with a group to help inform a potential hypothetical client, Women Tech Women Yes, 
where they might best place their workers to collect emails and raise awareness for a Gala held in the early summer. 
To this end, my group and I decided to start by envisioning the demographics the organization might want to target. 
Aside from the evident women in tech positions, we also decided that individuals in universities and those in all girl high 
schools and charter schools would be great to target.

We mapped out all of the points of interest in NYC – locations of all of the tech companies, the high schools, and so forth – 
and began looking at subway stations near each of these.  We chose 5 and began to perform data analysis on the MTA turnstile 
datasets to find the ones with the highest traffic, so as to reach the largest number of people in the demographic as possible.

We created a new variable, 'traffic', that would count how many people entered or exited a turnstile for each time period by 
finding the delta in the values for these columns for each turnstile.  Then, we checked for outliers and discarded any values 
that were negative or absurdly high, as they usually indicated turnstile malfunctions.  Finally, we graphed the values of 
traffic for each station we had chosen to find the station with the highest amount of traffic, which would identify the 
highest volume station with the target demographic.

This was just project 1, so I'm excited for the upcoming work I'll be doing!
